1. I installed git on my local machine
2. I created a public repo through github.com
3. Deployed a key from public repo to give access to local repo
4. I created a separate branch, "student" to make updates where I created 
lab1.txt
5. I ran "git add .", "git commit -m "with a comment"", and "git push 
origin student" to track, commit, and push changes to the student branch 
of the local repo
6. I ran "git checkout main" to swap to main branch where I ran "git 
merge student" to merge finalized changes from student branch to main 
branch
7. Finally, I ran "git push origin main" to push changes to the public 
repo.
